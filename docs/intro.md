# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on **Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics**!

## What You'll Learn

This book teaches you how to build autonomous humanoid robots through four core modules:

1. **Module 1: ROS 2** - Robot software communication and control
2. **Module 2: Digital Twin** - Safe testing via simulation (Gazebo & Unity)
3. **Module 3: AI-Robot Brain** - AI-driven autonomy with NVIDIA Isaac
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action** - End-to-end autonomous behavior

## Who This Book Is For

This book is designed for **CS-background AI and robotics students** who want to understand how to build intelligent, autonomous humanoid robots.

**Prerequisites**:
- Programming experience (Python preferred)
- Basic understanding of AI/ML concepts
- Familiarity with data structures and algorithms

## How to Use This Book

The modules are designed to be taken sequentially, as each builds on the previous:
- Start with Module 1 to understand ROS 2 fundamentals
- Progress through Module 2 for simulation skills
- Learn AI-driven autonomy in Module 3
- Integrate everything in the Module 4 capstone project

Each module includes:
- **Overview**: Why this technology matters
- **Architecture**: How systems are designed
- **Tooling**: Practical framework usage
- **Integration**: Connections to other modules
- **Summary**: Key takeaways and limitations

## Get Started
