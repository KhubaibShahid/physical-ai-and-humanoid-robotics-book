# Glossary

A comprehensive list of technical terms used throughout this book.

## A

**Action** - A ROS 2 communication pattern for long-running tasks that provide feedback and can be preempted.

**Actuator** - A mechanical component that moves or controls a mechanism (e.g., motor, servo).

**Autonomous Navigation** - The ability of a robot to navigate without human intervention.

## C

**Collision Detection** - The process of detecting when objects in a simulation or real environment intersect.

**Control Loop** - A feedback system that continuously adjusts robot behavior based on sensor inputs.

## D

**DDS (Data Distribution Service)** - The middleware protocol used by ROS 2 for inter-process communication.

**Digital Twin** - A virtual representation of a physical robot used for simulation and testing.

**DOF (Degrees of Freedom)** - The number of independent ways a robot joint or system can move.

## G

**Gazebo** - An open-source 3D robotics simulator with physics engine support.

## I

**Isaac Sim** - NVIDIA's robotics simulation platform built on Omniverse.

**IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)** - A sensor that measures acceleration and rotation.

## J

**Joint** - A connection point between two robot links that allows relative motion.

## K

**Kinematics** - The study of robot motion without considering forces (forward and inverse kinematics).

## L

**LiDAR** - Light Detection and Ranging sensor for measuring distances using laser light.

**Link** - A rigid body component in a robot structure connected by joints.

**LLM (Large Language Model)** - AI models like GPT used for natural language understanding.

## M

**Message** - A data structure passed between ROS 2 nodes via topics.

**Path Planning** - The process of finding a collision-free path from start to goal.

**Physics Engine** - Software that simulates physical interactions (gravity, collisions, friction).

**Pub-Sub (Publisher-Subscriber)** - A messaging pattern where publishers send data to topics that subscribers receive.

## Q

**QoS (Quality of Service)** - ROS 2 configuration for message delivery reliability and performance.

**Sensor** - A device that measures physical properties (e.g., camera, LiDAR, IMU).

**Service** - A ROS 2 communication pattern for synchronous request-response interactions.

**SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** - The process of building a map while tracking the robot's position.

## T

**Topic** - A named channel in ROS 2 for asynchronous message passing.

**Transform (TF)** - A representation of coordinate frame relationships in ROS 2.
